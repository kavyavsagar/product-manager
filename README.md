# Product Manager

This project was created to manage products which performs CRUD operations. Its build up with Angular 4, Material Component and Flex Layouts.

Angular Crud operations let us get, update, post and delete any kind data. Iam using http requests to perform all these crud operations. For json data, I will be using json-server to mockup localhost api. 

Angular flex layout provides HTML UI layout for this applications using Flexbox. I have included material components for making the better appearence of application. Components which i used for theming are Data Table, Sorting, Filtering, Snackbar, Modal popup, Toolbar, Form control, Material icons etc.
